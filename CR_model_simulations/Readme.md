# Consumer-Resource modelling

This repository contains the code to produce the default consumer resource model and the highly-incuced strains version (with a physiological update of uptake rates), measuting how resource diversity affects alpha diversity (Shannon's diversity index).

## Usage
Just use the Jupyter notebook CR_model_figure_production.ipynb file (sourcing a custom made consumer-resource model python file - consumer_resource.py) to generate the simulations and figures.
