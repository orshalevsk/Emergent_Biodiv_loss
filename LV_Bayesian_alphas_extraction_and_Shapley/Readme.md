# Lotka Volterra fitting of experimental data, using Bayesian extraction of alphas and running Shapley analysis

This repository contains the code to produce the results for the Alphas extraction and Shapley analysis (as in Fig 2B).

## Usage
Just use the Jupyter Bayesian_Regression_pipeline.ipynb file, and decompress the Auxillary_data.zip to generate the simulations and figures.
